Hi, my name is Kristen Dhuse.  I live in Renton, WA with my husband and daughter and our two cats.  I have  
lived in western Washington my whole life.  I enjoy the proximity to the mountains as well as to the water.
My original degree is in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Washington.  I really like Legos.
I enjoy skiing and road biking, although I don't get to do them as much as I would like to anymore.
I also love to travel.  I hope to eventually see all 7 continents.  As of now, I have been to North America (duh!),
Europe, Africa, and Australia.
