Hi, my name is Kristen Dhuse.  I live in Renton, WA with my husband, daughter, and our two cats.  I have  
lived in western Washington my whole life.  I enjoy the proximity to the mountains as well as to the water.
My original degree is in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Washington.  I really like Legos.
I enjoy skiing and road biking, although I don't get to do them as much as I would like to anymore.
I also love to travel.  I hope to eventually see all 7 continents.  As of now, I have been to North America (duh!),
Europe, Africa, and Australia.

# Programming Background:
This is my third quarter in this program.  I took CS 165 summer quarter and had a lot of fun.  My favorite 
program that I made for that class was my final project where I made a game of Connect Four.  The game 
can be played by either one or two players.  If you choose to play it with one player, you get to play 
against the computer.  I made the computer player smart so that it is actually fairly challenging to win 
against the computer player.

Outside of school, my husband and I enjoy working on projects with our Raspberry Pi.  For our current project,
we connected our Raspberry Pi to our garage door motors.  We wrote a program that allows us to access a website
and check the status of our garage doors.  If one of the doors is open, we can click a button to close the door.
It also works to open a door if it is closed.  We are still finishing up soldering the circuits to make it
permanent.  It has been a simple, but fun project that I find really useful since I am always wondering if I
remembered to shut the garage door when I am away from the house.
