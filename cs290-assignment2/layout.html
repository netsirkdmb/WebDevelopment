    Hi, my name is Kristen Dhuse. I live in Renton, WA with my husband, daughter, and our two cats. I have lived in western 
    Washington my whole life. I enjoy the proximity to the mountains as well as to the water. My original degree is in 
    Mechanical Engineering from the University of Washington. I really like Legos. I enjoy skiing and road biking, although 
    I don't get to do them as much as I would like to anymore. I also love to travel. I hope to eventually see all 7 
    continents. As of now, I have been to North America (duh!), Europe, Africa, and Australia.
    </p>

    I took last quarter off from school for the birth of my daughter. She was born on January 23rd and it has been a wild, 
    but fun ride so far. She is only 11 weeks old, but already it is hard to imagine life without her. My husband went back 
    to work the same week that classes started again, so I am getting the hang of doing things on my own during the day now.
